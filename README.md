# At Coder Prep 🏆

## Summary

This repo will contain my progress in preparing for the [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) programming contest.

## Repo Folder Structure 📁

- Each challenge in which I participated (or that I tried to solve for prep) has its own folder: `ABC250`, `ABC244` etc...
- The template I am using to solve problems is in the `template_cpp` folder

## Third party libraries used / Thanks 🙏

- [At Coder Archive](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/#/table/alixfachin) to look at past problems
- [At Coder Command Line](https://github.com/Tatamo/atcoder-cli) to create the folder structure for each contest, download test descriptions
- [At Code Repository](https://github.com/tsugitta/atcoder/blob/master/contests/arc117/arc117_a/test.cpp) Great repository of past problems, it gave me a good starting point to create my set of templates. (@tsugitta is using a YAML file for the tests, I wanted to use the format given to me by the AtCoder CLI...)

## My progress: 😊

- Public information at <https://atcoder.jp/users/alixfachin>. The road is still long! 😅
